- Recommended Versioning Strategy (Semantic Versioning)

A common standard is Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 1.2.5):

    Major (1.x.x): You broke something (API change). Old scripts might not run.

    Minor (x.2.x): You added a feature (e.g., a new flux scheme) but old scripts still work.

    Patch (x.x.5): You fixed a bug.
